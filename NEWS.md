# dials 0.0.2.9000

## Breaking changes

* All parameter _objects_ are now parameter _functions_. For example, the 
pre-configured object `mtry` is now a function, `mtry()`, with arguments for the
`range` and the `trans`form. This provides greater flexibility in parameter
creation, and should feel more natural.

# dials 0.0.2

* Parameter objects now contain code to finalize their values and a number of helper functions for certain data-specific parameters. A `force` option can be used to avoid updating the values.  
* Parameter objects are printed differently inside of tibbles. 
* `regularization` was changed to `penalty` in a few models to be consistent with [this change](tidymodels/model-implementation-principles@08d3afd). 
* `batch_size` and `threshold` were added.
* Added a set of parameters for the `textrecipes` package [issue 16](https://github.com/tidymodels/dials/issues/16). 

# dials 0.0.1
