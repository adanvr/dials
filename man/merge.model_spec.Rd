\usage{
\method{merge}{model_spec}(x, y, ...)

\method{merge}{param_grid}(x, y, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{A combination of one \pkg{parsnip} model object (that has class
\code{"model_spec"}) and one parameter grid resulting from \code{\link[=grid_regular]{grid_regular()}} or
\code{\link[=grid_random]{grid_random()}}. As long as this combination is present, the order that
they are provided in does not matter.}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}
}
\value{
A list containing updated model objects.
}
\description{
\pkg{parsnip} contains model objects that have consistent names with
\pkg{dials}. \code{merge()} can be used to easily update any of the main parameters
in a \pkg{parsnip} model.

For more information and examples, see the article,
