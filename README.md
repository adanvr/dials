## Overview

This package contains tools to create and manage values of tuning
parameters and is designed to integrate well with the
[`parsnip`](https://github.com/topepo/parsnip) package.

The name reflects the idea that tuning predictive models can be like
turning a set of dials on a complex machine under
duress.
